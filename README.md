# Josh.ai styling

The first goal with this project is to achieve the scroll effect found at the very top of Josh.ai/nano. I'm getting close to reaching my goal of cycling throuh the fullsizeImages array on scroll to create a sort of "flipbook" effect where the background image if the div changes to the next index of the fullsizeImages array when activley scrolling.
